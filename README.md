# Reverse_Bits

There is a song concert gaing to happen in the city. The price of each ticket is equal to the number obtained after reversing the bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer 'n'.

Sample Input:

2
0
12

Sample Output:

 0
 805306368

Explanation:

For the first test case :

Since the given number N = 0 is represented as 00000000000000000000000000000000 in its binary representation. So after reversing the bits, it will become 00000000000000000000000000000000 which is equal to 0 only. So the output is 0.     



For the second test case :

Since the given number N = 12 is represented as 00000000000000000000000000001100 in its binary representation. So after reversing the bits, it will become 0110000000000000000000000000000, which is equal to 805306368 only. So the output is 805306368.
